Team name: xjtu_asic
Expected result (avg ns/square): 30.8ns , 2 cycles @ 65 Mhz, 
Design documentation (below): 
- Referencing ozturk design, but we set the sq_out and sq_in as 65 segments respectively.
- 2 cycles are used for modular squaring and the process is shown in "modular_square/model/pictures.txt".
- Cycle 1: Calculate the high part of squaring.
- Cycle 2: Generate the reduction numbers and Calculate the low part of squaring, and then add up them.
- This design needs 1089 DSPs because of the spliting of the squaring.
- The last four state: "FINISH0", "FINISH1", "FINISH2" and "FINISH3" are used for the last modular squaring loop to 
  output the completely reduced result.
- A sample circuit diagram is shown in "modular_square/model/circuit_diagram.pdf".
